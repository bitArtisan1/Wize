# Wize
Wize, a C++ UCI-compliant chess engine, integrates a neural network (NNUE) for accurate evaluation and employs a range of advanced search techniques like LazySMP and Multithreading within Alpha-Beta framework, Wize strives to be a top-tier engine but also serves as a valuable resource for developers to enhance their own chess engines.

## Improvements
  * Implement Syzygy Bases, SyzygyPath, ...
  * Improve the NN Structure
## Current ELO
  * **ELO: 2850-3000~** 

 ## Requirements
 * Wize software requires GCC(GNU Compiler Collection) or CLang, C++ version: CXX >= C++17 !
 * It is recommended that the terminal uses a TrueType Font (ttf), Consolas and other monospaced fonts are recommended for the best user experience [Unicode characters and ANSI escape code] (However, most engines are 
   linked directly to the GUI and don't really need to interact with the terminal).
 
 ## Installation/Usage
 Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yanpuri/Wize.git
```
Then, in the directory:
```bash
$ cd Wize\Wize
$ make
$ Wize.exe
```
Run the generated .exe file in the install dir.
 
* How to work the engine?
The UCI (Universal Chess Interface) serves as a widely adopted protocol for interacting with a chess engine and is the preferred method for communication in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and chess-related tools. The guidelines are outlined in the UCI protocol, which can be accessed and referenced at this link http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/block/uci.htm
